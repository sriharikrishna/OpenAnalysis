Context-Sensitive Flow-Sensitive Activity Analysis (CSFSAA) 
Based on Variable Dependence Graph (VDG)
-----------------------------------------------------------

- This Analysis is specific to ForTran77

- Based on CSFI activity analysis with the following extensions



- Node key: 

  - SymHandle -> IRSymHandle: pair of <IRHandle, SymHandle>

  - For normal statements with one destination variable, key is 
    the statement handle + the symbol of the destination variable.

  - For call expressions, CallHandle + SymHandle of the actual
    parameter. 

  - For each of the formal parameters, two nodes are created: one for
    IN and the other for OUT.

    IN:  IRHandle(1) + SymHandle
    OUT: IRHandle(2) + SymHandle

  - The elements of the dependence matrices are also IRSymHandles.
